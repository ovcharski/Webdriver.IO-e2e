Demo automation testing framework created with Webdriver.IO. Copying the existing Playwright tests from [ovcharski/playwright-e2e](https://github.com/ovcharski/playwright-e2e/), but rewriting and reusing them with Webdriver.IO.
## What is Webdriver.IO

WebdriverIO is a progressive automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile application.

- Extendable - Adding helper functions, or more complicated sets and combinations of existing commands is simple and really useful
- Compatible - WebdriverIO can be run on the WebDriver Protocol for true cross-browser testing as well as Chrome DevTools Protocol for Chromium based automation using Puppeteer.
- Feature Rich - The huge variety of built-in and community plugins allows to easily integrate and extend the setup to fulfill the requirements.
- Based on Web Standards - WebdriverIO leverages the power of the WebDriver and WebDriver-BiDi protocol that is developed and supported by all browser vendors and guarantees a true cross-browser testing experience. 
- True Open Source - a truly open source project that is run with open governance and owned by a non-profit entity called OpenJS Foundation

## Current Status

Webdriver.IO project after initial setup completion. A few tests by default from the setup. Real tests are yet to be written.
